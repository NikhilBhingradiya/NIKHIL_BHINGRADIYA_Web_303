        Hrithik Roshan.

        Hrithik Roshan (pronounced born 10 January 1974) is an Indian actor who works in Hindi films.
        He has portrayed a variety of characters and is known for his dancing skills. One of the highest-paid actors in
        India, he has won many awards, including six Filmfare Awards, of which four were for Best Actor. Starting from
        2012, he has appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 several times based on his income and popularity.

        Roshan has frequently collaborated with his father, Rakesh Roshan. He made brief appearances as a child actor in
        several films in the 1980s and later worked as an assistant director on four of his father's films. His first
        leading role was in the box-office success Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), for which he received several awards.
        Performances in the 2000 terrorism drama Fiza and the 2001 ensemble melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...
        consolidated his reputation but were followed by several poorly received films.

        The 2003 science fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya, for which Roshan won two Filmfare Awards, was a turning point in
        his film career; he later starred as the titular superhero in its sequels: Krrish (2006) and Krrish 3 (2013). He
        earned praise for his portrayal of a thief in Dhoom 2 (2006), Mughal emperor Akbar in Jodhaa Akbar (2008) and a
        quadriplegic in Guzaarish (2010). He achieved further commercial success by playing the lead in the 2011 drama
        Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the 2012 revenge drama Agneepath, the 2014 action thriller Bang Bang!, the 2019 biopic
        Super 30, and the 2019 action thriller War; the lattermost ranks as his highest-grossing release.

                On 20 December 2000, Roshan married Sussanne Khan in a private ceremony in Bangalore.[155] Despite their
                religious difference—Roshan is a Hindu and Khan is a Muslim—Roshan says that he equally valued her
                beliefs.[7] The couple has two sons, Hrehaan (born in 2006) and Hridhaan (born in 2008).[156][157] They
                separated in December 2013 and their divorce was finalised in November 2014.[155]

                Roshan and Sussanne maintained that they parted amicably.[158] In 2016, he filed a lawsuit against his
                Krrish 3 co-star Kangana Ranaut, accusing her of cyber stalking and harassment. Denying the charges,
                Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover up their
                affair.[159] Owing to a lack of evidence, the Mumbai Police closed the case later that year.[160]

                Roshan considered quitting the film industry after two assailants fired bullets at his father in
                2000.[27] Later that December, he was involved in a controversy when Nepalese newspapers accused him of
                stating in a Star Plus interview that he hated Nepal and its people. This led to protests in the
                country, a ban on screening of his films, and four people's deaths after street violence.[161] Nepalese
                people threatened to "bury [him] alive" if he ever visited the country.[162] Star Plus, for its part,
                stated that Roshan "did not touch upon Nepal." The violence calmed down after Roshan wrote a two-page
                rejoinder in which he denied having made any claim against the country. Nepali actress Manisha Koirala
                helped distribute it to newspapers and a local television station.[163]
